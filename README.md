Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are mathematical equations that involve functions of several variables and their partial derivatives. They are fundamental in describing various physical phenomena such as heat conduction, wave propagation, fluid dynamics, and quantum mechanics. PDEs can be classified into several types, including elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic, each representing different kinds of physical processes. Solutions to PDEs are crucial in fields like engineering, physics, finance, and biology, helping to model and predict complex systems' behavior over space and time.
